The following analyses can be conducted on trios.

# Autosomal dominant
Since both parents are unaffected, do these represent de novo mutations not seen in the parents?

# Autosomal recessive
So this would be a rare variant, het in the parents but hom in the affected child.

# Compound hets analysis:
There are two interpretations:
1)
The first requires phasing.
A parent is het at different locations in the gene but due to recombination in the parent both damaging variants end up on the same chromosome.
Hence child carries both damaging variants on the same chromosome, gene doesn't work.
2)
The other interpretation is that this is a burden were the parents are het at different variants, and the child has a higher burden of hets in a gene.
Both versions of gene are defective.  Burden in child higher than in parents.

# LOH analysis
a deletion has occurred so that neighbouring markers all appear hom or wt while they are het in parents

# CNV analysis
